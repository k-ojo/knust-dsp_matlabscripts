StudySpace Plus offers a new answer to the problems KNUST students face when they try to find good places to study. By setting up comfy study spots in campus dorms, StudySpace Plus wants to make college life better for students. We give them everything they need to study well: fast internet comfy chairs, places to get snacks, shops to fix computers, and nice-looking rooms.

We've looked at what students want, and we found that about 30% of them are looking for other places to study because the university's spaces are too crowded. By putting our study spots in dorms, we can meet this need and create a place where students can come together to do well in school.
The money outlook looks good, with income set to grow a lot in the first three years. Our plans to market and promote, along with team-ups and better services, will make sure customers are happy and come back.
