Introduction to 10 the point.

The whole idea here is that Study Space Plus (S2+) shall be a major stakeholder in the provision of comfortable, accessible and well equipped learning centres for all students who are seeking solutions to technology-related problems and contemporary interior design ideas.

Study Space Plus (S2+) has come up with some objectives which include;

▪ Accessibility;

• Set up one hub during the initial year of operation.

• By the first 5 years, 90% of students around KNUST campus should live within a fifteen-minute walking distance from the nearest Study Space Plus (S2+) hub.

• In its first decade, at least 80 percent out of those who either live on or close to campus must have access to our repair and interior design services just by clicking on their phones.

▪ Comfort and Facilities:

Each study space plus would be fitted with high-speed internet, top notch computing facilities as well as soft seats where one can consult our IT professionals as well as repair experts.

▪ Solution Provision:

Repairing and designing interiors for almost 70% people within the vicinity of Kwame Nkrumah University Of Science And Technology(KNUST) Campus by Study Space Plus(S2+).

▪ Branch Expansion:

We will open ten branches each in twenty years’ time to increase accessibility among student populace at large
